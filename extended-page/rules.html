    <h1>The Extreme Demon Slayers Challenge list Rules</h1>
    <p>Here are the rules for getting your level/record accepted on the list.</p>
    <br>
    <!-- ================================== -->
    <h2>Records</h2>
    <div>Records show that you have completed a level on the list.</div>
    <li>Your record should be sent through either YouTube, Twitch or Google Drive.</li>
    <li>Legacy Records will be accepted</li>
    <li>dont hack!</li>
    <br>
    <!-- ================================== -->
    <h2>Submitting Your Level to the List</h2>
    <li>Rules</li>
    <li>1. No spam challenges/awkward inconsistent spam {exception: if you have spam that flows really well with other high cps gameplay then its fine}</li>
    <li>2. Level must have decent effort put into it (level must be atleast structured)</li>
    <li>3. The Levels Publisher, Verifier and Atleast one Creator must all be Members of the EDS</li>
    <li>4. Level can't be over 45 seconds long</li>
    <li>5. Level must be over 3 seconds long</li>
    <li>6. Level has to be original (cant steal gameplay from other levels or be a cut part from another level) INSPIRATION IS ALLOWED</li>
    <li>7. Level cant be absolute trash to play (avoid chokepoints and awkward gameplay)</li>
    <li>8. No duplicated gp levels (levels with a piece of gp duplicated multiple times, for example: 3sh in hell) {exception: small things like 3 triples at the end of a level are ok, just as long as a majority of the level is unique}</li>
    <li>9. Level cant have any skips/secret ways (creator will get notified about a found secret way/skip, if they do not fix it then the level will be removed)</li>
    <li>10. Level must be hard enough to place on the list (harder than the level currently placed at #50)</li>
    <br>
    <!-- ================================== -->
    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <li>Any record run must begin at the start of the level and continue until the last click is succesfully passed. A record is still valid even if you get 0 deaths and 100% accuracy in Noclip Accuracy or just use one attempt in Practice Mode.</li>
    <li>It is necessary that there are <b>audible clicks</b> present throughout the entire run, whether the footage is finished or raw. A record without clicks will definitely be disregarded!</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <!-- ================================== -->
    <h2>Bannable Punishments</h2>
    <li>Show Hitboxes On Death is allowed.</li>
    <li>Physics Bypass, 2.1 and Click Between Frames are allowed.</li>
    <li>Other then that its just common sense, Dont use obvious hacks such as Noclip, Speedhack, Hitboxes etc.
    <br>
