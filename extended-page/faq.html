    <h1>List Placements</h1>
    <h2>Level Eligibility</h2>
    <li>To be considered for acceptance on the Demon List, <b>a level must be rated Demon in-game</b>. We avoid the otherwise unavoidable situation of the list being filled with nearly impossible challenges or "joke" levels by using TGDPS's rating system as a standard for list placement. The list won't include unrated levels because it would be unpredictable and challenging to keep up with.</li>
    <li>For a level to be placed, it must be an <b>Easy Demon</b>.</li>
    <li>This list also <b>focuses 1-player levels</b>. For example, "Lost Castle" is a 2-player level and yet is rated as a demon, so it will not be included on the list.</li>
    <li>Only rated levels with correlating authentic verification videos are ensured to be taken into account. As long as a level has at least one genuine victor, it can be placed even if the verifications were hacked or not done at all.</li>
